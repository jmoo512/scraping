# My Scraping Projects

## Card Map

This app is designed to map card IDs from one Magic: The Gathering site to the next. Most sites have their own card IDs, and this app attempts to use data from [mtgjson](http://www.mtgjson.com) and [scryfall](http://www.scryfall.com) to map them based on their universal collector number for each set. Work in progress for a much larger project TBA.

## Price Scrape

This app scrapes price data from Cardsphere.com (with permission) to populate card and deck prices for [PauperBattleBox](https://www.pauperbattlebox.com)

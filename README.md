# My Scraping Projects

## Card Map

This app is designed to map card IDs from one Magic: The Gathering site to the next. Most sites have their own card IDs, and this app attempts to use data from [mtgjson](http://www.mtgjson.com) and [scryfall](http://www.scryfall.com) to map them based on their universal collector number for each set.

## Price Scrape

This app scrapes price data from Cardsphere.com (with permission) to populate deck prices for pauperbattlebox.com
